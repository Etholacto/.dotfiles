# My Personal Dotfiles

These are my personal configuration files. Feel free to use them, but note that they are tailored to my system and preferences.

## Warning

⚠️ **WARNING**: The `setup.sh` script is intended for Linux systems only. Running it on other platforms may cause issues.

Use the script at your own discretion. It’s recommended to review the script before executing it as it will make chnages to your system.
